# Building EventsQR Android App

Since users need an actual APK file to install on their phones, here are the options:

## Option 1: Build APK Yourself (Recommended)

### Prerequisites:
- Install Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/studio
- Install Java JDK 8 or later

### Steps:
1. Open Android Studio
2. Select "Open an existing project"
3. Choose the `android-app` folder from this EventsQR directory
4. Wait for Gradle sync to complete
5. Connect an Android device or create an emulator
6. Click "Run" button or press Shift+F10

### To Create APK for Distribution:
1. In Android Studio: Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)
2. APK will be created in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`
3. Share this APK file with users

## Option 2: Use Online Build Services

### GitHub Actions (Free)
- Upload the android-app code to GitHub
- Set up GitHub Actions to build APK automatically
- Download built APK from Actions artifacts

### Alternative Services:
- **Appetize.io** - Test in browser
- **CircleCI** - CI/CD with free tier
- **Bitrise** - Mobile CI/CD platform

## Option 3: Simplified APK Structure

For immediate testing, here's what the final APK needs:

### Required Files:
- AndroidManifest.xml (with permissions)
- All Java classes compiled to DEX
- Layout XML files
- Menu resources  
- ZXing barcode scanner library
- Gson library for JSON parsing

### Key Permissions in AndroidManifest.xml:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />
```

## Quick Test Solution

For immediate testing without Android Studio:

1. Use an online Android emulator like:
   - **appetize.io** - Upload APK and test in browser
   - **replit.com** - Android development environment

2. Or use MIT App Inventor for a simpler version:
   - Visual drag-and-drop interface
   - Built-in QR scanner components
   - Automatic APK generation

Would you like me to:
1. Create a simplified MIT App Inventor version?
2. Set up GitHub Actions to auto-build APKs?
3. Create a web-based version that works on mobile browsers?
